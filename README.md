## BRAIN_TUMOR CLASSIFICATION

##Project Objectives:

The primary objectives of this brain tumor classification project are as follows:

     To read an MRI scan in DICOM format and convert it into a NumPy array for manipulation.To apply processing techniques using TensorFlow to identify the type of brain tumor present in the scan 
     *To classify the scan into one of the following classes:
     *Glioma
     *Meningioma
     *Pituitary tumor
     *No tumor
     
##Methodology:

The following is a brief overview of the methodology used in this project:
    *Import the necessary libraries - NumPy,Matplotlib,Sklearn and Pandas
    *Load the input MRI scan in DICOM format and convert it into a NumPy array
    *Train a deep learning model to classify brain tumors
    *Classify the input MRI scan using the trained model
    *Display the input MRI scan along with the predicted class label

##Conclusion:

In conclusion, this brain tumor classification project using Python is a simple yet powerful program that can classify brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy. This project has immense practical applications in the field of medicine, as it can be used to automate the diagnosis of brain tumors. By utilizing the advanced features of TensorFlow, this project showcases the power of Python programming language in solving real-world problems with ease and efficiency.
